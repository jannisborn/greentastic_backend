### Compare transportation means - feature by feature and according to your own preferences
Type your location into the search field, upon pressing <Enter>, the app performs a handy autocompletion. Choose the desired target destination, then enter the start location or just use your current location. You will be prompted with several means of transportation (car, bike, walk, transit but even ebike, escooter or taxi). The proposals are sorted according to an overall score that combines `costs`, `duration`, `co2 emissions`, `calories burnt` and `pollution`. The intuitive color scheme allows to assess easily which transporation type is best for which metric. Choose your preferred option and Greentastic will draw the track onto your map. Easily toogle between `standard`, `hybrid` or `satellite` maps. In your profile, you can customize which metrics matter most to you. Do you want to save money? Are you in a rush? Or want to be environmently friendly? Just specify the weights and Greentastics recommendation will change. Finally, the history of chosen tracks is recorded in a statistics overview page - check it out to see how much C02 you saved and what your favorite types of transporation are.
